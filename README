This is puppet-yum a puppet module for yum.

Please read the INSTALL file for instructions on getting this installed.

This code may be a work in progress. The interfaces may change without notice.
Patches are welcome, but please be patient. They are best received by email.
Please ping me if you have big changes in mind, before you write a giant patch.

Module specific notes:
* This module has some additional "magic" functionality.
* You probably don't need it, and aren't interested in it, so please ignore.
* This isn't intended as an "awesome, do everything yum" module.
* This is intended to be good enough for what I needed, for other dependencies.

Dependencies:
* puppetlabs-stdlib (required)


Happy hacking,
